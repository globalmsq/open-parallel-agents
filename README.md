# Open Parallel Agents

## Introduction

We've created the GitHub repository [open-parallel-agents](https://github.com/globalmsq/open-parallel-agents).

We believe Cursor's parallel agents feature will have as much revolutionary power as ChatGPT. This repository is for sharing knowledge to solve problems faster than others through collaboration.

## The Shock

What shocked me the most is that my primary communication tool is no longer Slack—it's now Cursor, thanks to the parallel agents feature.

In the past, we assigned tasks to people via Slack. Now, we're assigning them to agents.

If ChatGPT brought 30% or 2x productivity, this could deliver at least 50x. That's the level of breakthrough we're talking about.

## The Difference

This will create a difference comparable to the iPhone's launch. In the future, people will carry personal LLM workstations—like DGX Spark— just as they carry laptops today.

That's the magnitude of change we're facing.

## Future Vision

People will increasingly work with AI rather than with other people. To make this happen, we'll need many new tools, deep thinking, and proactive problem-solving.

We'll tackle these challenges together in this space.

## Community Goals

We envision this community not just as an online space, but also offline—widening our perspectives and diving deep over a cup of coffee.

This open-source project will play a crucial role in achieving A2A (Agent-to-Agent) communication and deliver at least 50x productivity gains in the process.

## Call to Action

Tremendous impact is expected—join us and participate!

We welcome critical feedback and contributions to push the boundaries of what's possible.
